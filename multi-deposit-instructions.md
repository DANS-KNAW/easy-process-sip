Multi-Deposit Instructions format
=================================

This document specifies the format of the Multi-Deposit Instructions (MDI) file. The MDI
file describes a multi-deposit, detailing:

* What dataset(s) to create from the multi-deposit.
* The dataset metadata for each dataset.
* Which files have audio/visual content, from which of them to derive streamable
  surrogates and where to host those.
  
General overview
----------------

* It is a UTF-8 encoded Comma Separated Values (CSV) file that conforms to
  [RFC4180]. If you are exporting an Excel spreadsheet to CSV, it is best to
  install [LibreOffice] and use its Calc application, which supports the required
  export without any extra steps. LibreOffice can also open Excel files.
* The first row of the file contains column headers.
* Subsequent rows contain values for only one target dataset. Multiple rows may
  together specify the values for one target dataset. However, rows that specify
  one dataset must be grouped together.
* There are three types of values, which will be explained below:
    1. the `DATASET` column
    2. metadata element
    3. file processing instruction


1 The DATASET column
--------------------

For some datasets there are multiple rows in the MDI file. This serves two purposes:

* Some metadata fields may have more than one value.
* Multiple files in the dataset may require special processing instructions.

All the rows that pertain to one dataset must have the same value in the `DATASET`
column.


2 Metadata elements
-------------------

The supported metadata elements are subdivided into the following groups:

* The following [Dublin Core elements]: `DC_TITLE`, `DC	_DESCRIPTION`,
  `DC_CREATOR`*, `DC_CONTRIBUTOR`*, `DC_SUBJECT`, `DC_PUBLISHER`,
  `DC_TYPE`, `DC_FORMAT`, `DC_IDENTIFIER`, `DC_IDENTIFIER_TYPE`, `DC_SOURCE`, `DC_LANGUAGE`.
* The following [Dublin Core Term elements]: `DCT_ALTERNATIVE`, `DCT_SPATIAL`,
  `DCT_TEMPORAL`, `DCT_RIGHTSHOLDER`, `DCT_DATE`, `DCT_DATE_QUALIFIER`, `DCT_LICENSE`.
* DANS specific specializations of Dublin Core: `DCX_CREATOR_TITLES`, 
  `DCX_CREATOR_INITIALS`, `DCX_CREATOR_INSERTIONS`,
  `DCX_CREATOR_SURNAME`, `DCX_CREATOR_DAI`, `DCX_CREATOR_ORGANIZATION`, `DCX_CREATOR_ROLE`,
  `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_TITLES`, `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_INITIALS`,
  `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_INSERTIONS`, `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_SURNAME`, `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_DAI`,
  `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_ORGANIZATION`, `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_ROLE`,
  `DCX_SPATIAL_SCHEME`, `DCX_SPATIAL_X`, `DCX_SPATIAL_Y`, `DCX_SPATIAL_NORTH`,
  `DCX_SPATIAL_SOUTH`, `DCX_SPATIAL_EAST`, `DCX_SPATIAL_WEST`,
  `DCT_TEMPORAL_SCHEME`, `DC_SUBJECT_SCHEME`,
  `DCX_RELATION_QUALIFIER`, `DCX_RELATION_TITLE`, `DCX_RELATION_LINK`.
* Other DANS specific metadata elements: `DDM_CREATED`, `DDM_AVAILABLE`,
  `DDM_AUDIENCE`, `DDM_ACCESSRIGHTS`, `DEPOSITOR_ID`.
* Fields that specify special properties for a file: `FILE_PATH`, `FILE_TITLE`,
  `FILE_ACCESSIBILITY`, `FILE_VISIBILITY`.
* Fields that specify the relation to a streaming surrogate on the Springfield
  platform: `SF_DOMAIN`, `SF_USER`, `SF_COLLECTION`, and `SF_PLAY_MODE`.
* The use of `DC_CREATOR` and `DC_CONTRIBUTOR` is deprecated in favor of the new
  `DCX_CREATOR_*` and `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_*` fields.

The following elements are required: `DC_TITLE`, `DC_DESCRIPTION`, `DCX_CREATOR_*`
(at least both the subfields `DCX_CREATOR_INITIALS` and `DCX_CREATOR_SURNAME` *or*
the subfield `DCX_CREATOR_ORGANIZATION`), `DDM_CREATED`, `DDM_AUDIENCE`, `DDM_ACCESSRIGHTS`.

### Semantics of the columns

#### Dublin Core (Term) elements
The semantics of the [Dublin Core elements] and the [Dublin Core Term elements] are 
defined on the Dublin Core website. 

#### Creators and contributors
The `DCX_CREATOR_*` and `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_*` elements follow the semantics of the 
corresponding Dublin Core elements. The only difference is that the description is
split into subfields that are fairly self-describing.

Note that the columns `DCX_CREATOR_ROLE` and `DCX_CONTRIBUTOR_ROLE` have to contain values from
the [DataCite ContributorType list].

#### Spatial
`DCT_SPATIAL` can contain any value that can be construed as "spatial characteristic" of the
dataset. A more specific value can be provided by means of the `DCX_SPATIAL_*` elements.

`DCX_SPATIAL_SCHEME` must currently be `RD`. Other schemes may be supported in the 
future. The scheme determines how the other `DCX_SPATIAL_*` elements are to be interpreted.
RD is the [Rijksdriehoeksco√∂rdinaten] scheme used in the Netherlands.

Either the pair `DCX_SPATIAL_X` and `DCX_SPATIAL_Y` (specifying a location) *or* all 
of `DCX_SPATIAL_NORTH`, `DCX_SPATIAL_SOUTH`, `DCX_SPATIAL_EAST`, `DCX_SPATIAL_WEST` 
(specifying a bounding box) must be used. Any other combination is illegal.

#### Relation
The generic `relation` element from Dublin Core is not supported. Only relations in the
form of URL's are accepted. `DCX_RELATION_QUALIFIER` is one of the 
[refinements of the relation element]. `DCX_RELATION_TITLE` is the title of the 
hyperlink if it is displayed on a web page and `DCX_RELATION_LINK` the URL to the
related resource. If a link is provided, a title should be given to provide context.

#### Identifier
`DC_IDENTIFIER_TYPE` gives extra meaning to the `DC_IDENTIFIER`. It can only have either one of the
following four values: {`ISBN`, `ISSN`, `NWO-PROJECTNR`, `ARCHIS-ZAAK-IDENTIFICATIE`} or be left empty.

#### Language
`DC_LANGUAGE` should be formatted as an [ISO 639-2](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) (both `B` and `T` variants are supported).
`AV_SUBTITLE_LANGUAGE` should be formatted as an [ISO 639-1](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php).

#### Format
`DC_FORMAT` can either have free text or be one of the elements listed in the [formats list](src/main/assembly/dist/cfg/acceptedMediaTypes.txt).
In the latter case an extra `xsi:type` is added to the resulting DDM xml.

#### User license
`DCT_LICENSE` can be one of the elements listed in the [licenses list](src/main/assembly/dist/cfg/licenses.txt).
This field must be used when `DDM_ACCESSRIGHTS` is set to `OPEN_ACCESS` and is not accepted when `DDM_ACCESSRIGHTS` is set to any other value.

#### Type
`DC_TYPE` can only have a value from the set {`Collection`, `Dataset`, `Event`, `Image`, 
`InteractiveResource`, `MovingImage`, `PhysicalObject`, `Service`, `Software`, `Sound`, 
`StillImage`, `Text`}. If no value is given, `Dataset` is chosen as a default.

#### Date
`DCT_DATE_QUALIFIER` can only have a value from the set {`valid`, `issued`, `modified`,
`dateAccepted`, `dateCopyrighted`, `dateSubmitted`}. If one of these values is given, `DCT_DATE` has
to be a date, formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`. If `DCT_DATE_QUALIFIER` isn't provided but the related
`DCT_DATE` is, the latter is considered to be free text.

#### File
`FILE_PATH`, `FILE_TITLE`, `FILE_ACCESSIBILITY`, `FILE_VISIBILITY` describe special properties of a file. For every
file that is described here, at least `FILE_PATH` and at least one of `FILE_TITLE`, `FILE_ACCESSIBILITY` and `FILE_VISIBILITY`
need to be provided. A file can only have one value for each of these properties.

`FILE_ACCESSIBILITY` and `FILE_VISIBILITY` provide a way to override the default accessibility and visibility respectively.
Their value must be one of: 'ANONYMOUS', 'RESTRICTED_REQUEST', 'RESTRICTED_GROUP', 'KNOWN' and 'NONE'. The default
accessibility is derived from the access category specified in the `DDM_ACCESSRIGHTS` field.

DDM_ACCESSRIGHTS                       | Default accessibility
---------------------------------------|----------------------
`OPEN_ACCESS`                          | `ANONYMOUS`
`OPEN_ACCESS_FOR_REGISTERED_USERS`     | `KNOWN`
`GROUP_ACCESS`                         | `RESTRICTED_GROUP`
`REQUEST_PERMISSION`                   | `RESTRICTED_REQUEST`
`NO_ACCESS`                            | `NONE`

Note that all A/V files must have the same `FILE_ACCESSIBILITY`. This is because only one audio or video presentation per dataset
is supported. It may consist of multiple files. The accessiblity of the presentation (i.e. the permission to play the presentation in
the EASY Web-UI) is the accessibility of the audio or video files.

The default visibility is `ANONYMOUS`.

#### Springfield
[Springfield Web TV] is the platform that DANS uses to host the streaming surrogates (versions)
of audiovisual data.

The metadata elements starting with `SF_` are used to create a streaming surrogate of
a audio or video presentation contained in the dataset:

* `SF_DOMAIN`, `SF_USER`, `SF_COLLECTION`, *together with the Fedora identifier of the resulting
  dataset in EASY* identify a presentation in Springfield that must be linked to by EASY. The link is created
  by adding a `dc:relation` metadata value to the dataset metadata. This relation
  is marked as having the `STREAMING_SURROGATE_RELATION` scheme and contains the
  URL of the Streaming Surrogate in Springfield. These fields may only be used if
  all of them are specified. Since the Fedora identifier will be minted *after* `easy-split-multi-deposit`
  runs, a placeholder is inserted into the deposit. During the ingest-flow this placeholder will
  be resolved to the correct identifier.
* All files in a dataset that are identified as audio/video (using mimetype detection) are added
  to this presentation by identifying them as such (and providing extra metadata) in `files.xml`.
* The data provided in `SF_DOMAIN`, `SF_USER` and `SF_COLLECTION` are stored for further processing
  in the `deposit.properties` file.
* `SF_PLAY_MODE` specifies how the video's are played in Springfield. The value must either be
  `continuous` or `menu`. This value is only allowed if `SF_DOMAIN`, `SF_USER` and `SF_COLLECTION`
  are provided as well. If `menu` is chosen, **every A/V file** must have `FILE_TITLE` defined as well.
* If SF_* fields are present, a `DC_FORMAT` for audio/ or video/ Internet Media Types is expected.

The metadata elements starting with `AV_` are used to provide extra metadata specific to audio/video files:

* The columns `AV_FILE_PATH`, `AV_SUBTITLES` and `AV_SUBTITLES_LANGUAGE` are used together to
  specify that an A/V file has its subtitles in another file, and what the language of those subtitles is.
  For example: `AV_FILE_PATH=myvideo.mp4, AV_SUBTITLES=nl.srt, AV_SUBTITLES_LANGUAGE=nl` means that
  `nl.srt` contains Dutch subtitles for the file `myvideo.mp4`. Note that the language has to be specified as
  [an ISO 639-1 language code](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php). To add multiple
  subtitles for one video, just add a new row with the same the value in `AV_FILE_PATH`.
* The information found in the `AV_*` columns is put into `files.xml`. A `dcterms:relation` element is added
  to the description of the A/V file. The text of the relation is the path of the subtitles file. An `xml:lang` attribute
  is added to the relation element to specify the language of the subtitles.

#### Base Revision
 If the deposit is a new version of an existing dataset, the BASE_REVISION column contains the
 UUID of the base revision of this dataset. Only one base revision should be given per deposit.

3 File Processing Instructions
------------------------------

Files in the Multi-Deposit Directory are only processed if they are located in
a sub-directory that has a matching `DATASET`-value in the MDI file.

For example, let us assume that there is a Multi-Deposit at the directory
`/uploads/customer-1/multi-deposit-2016-01-01` and that the output deposits directory 
is located at `/data/csv-deposits`. Let us further suppose that the lay-out of the Multi-Deposit
Directory is as follows:

    /uploads/customer-1/deposit-2016-01-01
                             |
                             +- instructions.csv
                             |
                             +- dataset-1
                             |      |
                             |      +- subdir-x
                             |      |     |
                             |      |     +- file-y
                             |      |     |
                             |      |     +- file-z
                             |      |     |
                             |      |     +- video1.mpeg
                             |      |
                             |      +- video02.mpeg
                             |
                             +- dataset-2
                             |
                             +- videos
                                   |
                                   +- video01.mpeg
                                   |
                                   +- video02.mpeg

* The Multi-Deposit Directory is `/uploads/customer-1/deposit-2016-01-01`
* The Output Deposits Directory is `/data/csv-deposits`
* The MDI file is `/uploads/customer-1/deposit-2016-01-01/instructions.csv`

Now if the MDI file contains "dataset-1" as a value for the `DATASET` field
for one of the described datasets then the program will look and find a matching
data files directory at `/uploads/customer-1/deposit-2016-01-01/dataset-1`. The
files in this directory are considered to be the payload for the target deposit.
The relative paths in "dataset-1" will be preserved.

The resulting deposit will have the following location and lay-out:

     /data/csv-deposits/deposit-2016-01-01-dataset-1/
                                      |
                                      +- deposit.properties
                                      |
                                      +- bag
                                          |
                                          +- bagit.txt
                                          | 
                                          +- baginfo.txt
                                          |
                                          +- <manifest-files>* (multiple manifest files, not elaborated here)
                                          |
                                          +- data
                                          |    |
                                          |    +- subdir-x
                                          |    |    |
                                          |    |    +- file-y
                                          |    |    |
                                          |    |    +- file-z
                                          |    |    |
                                          |    |    +- video1.mpeg
                                          |    |
                                          |    +- video2.mpeg
                                          |
                                          +- metadata
                                               |
                                               +- dataset.xml
                                               |
                                               +- files.xml
                               
Note that to create a unique deposit-directory the Multi-Deposit Directory name is 
combined with the `DATASET` value.
