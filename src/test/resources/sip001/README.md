Summary
=======

A sample Submission Information Package (SIP) directory for testing the Process SIP 
tool. 

Contents
========

* A SIP Instructions file ("instructions.csv")
* One dataset directory ("dataset-1") with a matching DATASET_ID in the SIP Instructions
  file
* Two directories without matching DATASET_ID in the SIP Instructions file ("misc-files" and 
  "videos").
* misc-files contains files for "dataset-2", which has no dataset directory in the 
  SIP, so all the files in it have explicit copy instructions in the SIP Instructions file
