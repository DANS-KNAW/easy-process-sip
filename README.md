Convert a Multi-Deposit splitting it into several Dataset Deposits.

SYNOPSIS
--------

    easy-split-multi-deposit [{--output-deposits-dir|-d} <dir>][{--springfield-inbox|-s} <dir>] <multi-deposit-dir>


DESCRIPTION
-----------

A command line tool to process a Multi-Deposit into several Dataset Deposit. A Multi-Deposit
is a deposit containing data files and metadata for several datasets. The tools splits the
Multi-Deposit into separate Dataset Deposit directories that can be ingested into the archive by 
[easy-ingest-flow].

The Multi-Deposit may also contain audio/visual data files that are to be sent to a Springfield TV
installation to be converted to a streamable surrogate.

`easy-split-multi-deposit` is controlled by the Multi-Deposit Instructions (MDI) file. This is a CSV file,
that must be located at `<multi-deposit-dir>/instructions.csv`. It should contain the metadata for the
datasets that are to be created and may also contain instructions about how to process individual files.
See the [Multi-Deposit Instructions] page for details.

If the MDI file is found and is correct the following actions are taken:

1. The MDI file is read and checked. If the contents is invalid the tool reports the errors and exits.
2. The necessary preconditions for the instructions to be carried out are checked. 
   If the preconditions are not met, the tool reports the problems and exits.
3. One or more deposit directories are created, one for each dataset
4. Depending on whether the MDI file contains any processing instructions for the audio/visual files 
   in the Multi-Deposit they may be sent to a Springfield Inbox directory for
   subsequent processing by the Springfield Streaming Media Platform, along with
   a Springfield Actions XML and---optionally---subtitles files.

1. Unzip the tarball to a directory of your choice, e.g. `/opt/`
2. A new directory called easy-split-mult-deposit-<version> will be created, referred to below as `${app.home}`
3. Create a symbolic link to the executable script in a directory that is in your `PATH`, e.g.

        ln -s ${app.home}/bin/easy-split-multi-deposit /usr/bin/easy-split-multi-deposit


### Configuration

General configuration settings can be set in `${app.home}/cfg/application.properties` and logging can be
